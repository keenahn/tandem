## Usage

Thanks for trying out Tandem. As the administrator, you will be setting up your
Groups. Your group members won't have to interact with our site at all.


### Members

Members are individual members of your groups.

In our system, they have a name, a phone number, and a timezone.

Members belong to a group, and then can belong to a pair.

You can add members one at a time or in bulk.

### Pairs

Pairs are how you define a relationship between two members. A Pair has
two members, an activity, and a daily reminder time.

### Groups

Groups are simply a collection of Members and Pairs.


## Reminders

After you have a created a pair, the two members will immediately receive a few
welcome messages telling them how to use our system. Our system works completely
over SMS.

Your group members will receive texts reminding them to do their activity. If
they don't reply with a "yes" within a certain window, they will receive another
message. They can also reschedule their activity with a simple message (like
"reschedule 2:40pm"), or just pass through encouragement ("Good job!").
